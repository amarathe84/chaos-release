= Checknode =

Things we want to check on a cluster. This may change runlevels, not sure yet.


*cpu MHz* - verify cpus are running at expected speed. 

*cpuspeed* - is cpuspeed working. Bios setting could be wrong and cpuspeed can't start.

*swap* - is the amount of swap available expected.

*bios version* - verify bios version is correct. All nodes of the same type should have the same version.

*interface IPs* - verify IP address match for the node

*IB card Firmware version* - verify IB firmware version. All nodes within a IB family should have the same firmware version installed.

*IB link speed* - verify IB card linked at the correct speed. 

*hard drive performance* - verify hard drive is ok. A slow hard drive means it is probably going to fail. 

*number of memory errors* - check number of memory errors that have occurred. Replace memory that is getting single bit memory errors, or worse multi-bit memory errors.

*ecc* - verify ecc is on, and the correct type is on. ECC types are:
 * S4ECD4ED = ECC with chipkill
 * SECDED = ECC, no chipkill

*amount of memory* - verify all the memory is available.

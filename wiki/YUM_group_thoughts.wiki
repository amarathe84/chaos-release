#YUM groups for CHAOS 5

= Details =

Just getting down some thoughts on YUM group structure for CHAOS 5

= YUM groups and purpose =

Base - rpms that go on all node. Maybe this should be extremely minimal and provide more YUM groups.

Slurm - generic slurm rpms, no interconnect specific slurm rpms

Desktop - rpms like openoffice and so on. Maybe we shoot this group in chaos, and move to Base YUM group?

Lustre - lustre client and tools

Lustre.server - lustre server and tools

nfsroot - rpms for booting diskless nodes

openib - rpms for running an OpenIB cluster, this will include Slurm YUM group and add IB specific slurm rpms

opt -rpms that use modules, and install into /opt

opt.openib - rpms that use modules, install into /opt, will require openib YUM group. Should directory structure in /opt have a sub dir with interconnect name?

opt.INTERCONNECT - Should we assume that more interconnects may come out, maybe just think 10GigE?

Drivers - Drivers that are cutting edge that we don't usually install, but some may need
